# Snake
## General
This version of Snake was programmed using the x86 Assembly programming language as well as a combination of Microsoft Visual Studio "tweaks" and the Irvine Library.
### Gameplay
Players control the snake using WASD keys for Up, Left, Down, and Right. Everytime the player eats a "fruit"(asterisk) the snake grows by one length. If the player accidently "bites" himself he loses one life. Lose three lives and the game is over
